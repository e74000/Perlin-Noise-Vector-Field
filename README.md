# Perlin Noise Flow Map Simulation

## About:

A simple simulation of how particles behave in a perlin noise flow map.

The color represents the angle and magnitude of the vector field and the particles are represented by a white pixel with a transparency inversely proportional to the velocity of the particle.

## How to use:

* Run the program,
* ???
* Press `Q` or `esc` to exit,
* Profit!
